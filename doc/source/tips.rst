Release package
---------------

Create a specific release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps are required to release a package.

* (Create a stable branch if necessary)
* Add a signed tag to the repository

  .. code-block:: console

     git checkout stable/xxxx (if necessary)
     git tag -s <version number>
     git show <version number>
     git push gerrit <version number>

  .. warning::

     Before pushinng a tag to gerrit, you are strongly suggested to
     test whether a generated package works as expected.

     .. code-block:: console

        git checkout <version number>
        python setup.py sdist
        pip install dist/networking-nec-<version number>.tar.gz

  To push a tag to gerrit, you must be a member of
  ``networking-nec-release`` gerrit group.

* Push a release package to PyPI.

  .. code-block:: console

     git checkout <version number>
     python setup.py sdist upload

  Once the upload succeeded, you can find a new release at
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/networking-nec.

  Before uploading a package to PyPI, you need to create your PyPI
  account and prepare a proper credential file ``~/.pypirc`` like below.

  .. code-block:: ini

     [distutils]
     index-servers =
       pypi

     [pypi]
     repository=https://pypi.python.org/pypi
     username=<your username>
     password=<your password>

Create a stable branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The detail is available at:
http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/drivers.html#release-management.

To create a (stable) branch, you must be a member of
``networking-nec-release`` gerrit group.

More information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the release process is explained in
`OpenStack Infrastructure User Manual
<http://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/>`_.

Requirements update
-------------------

In OpenStack projects, requirements.txt and test-requirements.txt
should be synced with ``global-requirements.txt`` in
http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/requirements/tree/.

To sync requirements manually:

1. Check out requirements repository:

   .. code-block:: console

      git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/requirements

2. Run update.py:

   .. code-block:: console

      cd requirements
      tox -e venv -- python update.py <networking-nec top directory>

To sync it automatically, you need to:

* setup the jenkins job ``gate-{name}-requirements``
  (it is usually unnecessary as ``python-jobs`` contains it),
* add ``check-requirements`` to ``zuul/layout.yaml`` in
  project-config, and
* add ``openstack/networking-nec`` to ``projects.txt`` in the
  requirements project.

Build and puslish the documentation
-----------------------------------

To build the documentation:

.. code-block:: console

   tox -e docs

and the generated documentation will be found under ``doc/build/html``.

To publish the documentation, we use http://pythonhosted.org/ now.
As of now, networking-nec is not a part of official OpenStack projects
and docs.openstack.org cannot be used.
To upload/update the document in http://pythonhosted.org/,
visit https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=pkg_edit&name=networking-nec.
(Note that you need to log-in to PyPI web site as networking-nec administrator.)

To prepare a zip file for a new document,

.. code-block:: console

   tox -e docs
   cd doc/build/html
   zip -r ../../../docs.zip .
   [Update docs.zip in pypi.python.org]

Third party CI
--------------

* The master information about setting up and operating a third party CI
  is available at
  http://docs.openstack.org/infra/system-config/third_party.html.
  It is better to check this site regularlly.

* The status of your third party CI system should be available at
  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ThirdPartySystems.
  For example, you have a planned power blackout, it is encouraged
  to update the corresponding page.
