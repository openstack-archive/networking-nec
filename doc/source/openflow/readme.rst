.. warning::

   NEC OpenFlow plugin was deprecated in OpenStack Liberty release (2015.2)
   and removed during Mitaka development cycle.
   Note that the production support will be continued based
   on the production support policy.

NEC OpenFlow plugin talks to OpenFlow Controller and each Neutron
would be mapped to an virtual layer-2 network slice on an OpenFlow
enabled network. The interface between the Neutron plugin and OpenFlow
Controller is RESTful API. This API is supported by two
implementations:

* `NEC ProgrammableFlow Controller <http://www.necam.com/SDN/>`_ (NEC Commercial Product)
* `Trema Sliceable Switch <https://github.com/trema/apps/tree/master/sliceable_switch>`_ (OSS)

This plugin consists of two components:

* **Plugin**: It processes Neutron API calls and controls OpenFlow
  controller to handle logical networks on OpenFlow enabled network.

* **Layer2-Agent**: It runs on each compute node. It gathers a mapping
  between a VIF and a switch port from local Open vSwitch and reports
  it to the plugin.
