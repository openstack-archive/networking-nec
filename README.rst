Neutron plugins/drivers for NEC networking products
===================================================

``networking-nec`` library provides Neutron plugins/drivers
for `NEC SDN networking products`_ (mainly OpenFlow related at now)
and `Trema`_ `Sliceable Switch`_ (reference implementation).

In 2015.1 release (Kilo development cycle) in OpenStack, Neutron
community decided to decompose vendor plugins/drivers from the neutron
code repo to address many pain points. NEC OpenFlow Neutron plugin is
maintained in a separate module.
