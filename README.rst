Neutron plugins/drivers for NEC networking products
===================================================

.. warning::

   The current plugin, NEC OpenFlow plugin, is deprecated in
   OpenStack Liberty release (2015.2).
   A new driver for NEC NWA (Network Automation) product is coming.
   Note that the production support will be continued based
   on the production support policy.

``networking-nec`` library provides Neutron plugins/drivers
for `NEC SDN`_ networking products` (mainly OpenFlow related at now)
and `Trema`_ `Sliceable Switch`_ (reference implementation).

In 2015.1 release (Kilo development cycle) in OpenStack, Neutron
community decided to decompose vendor plugins/drivers from the neutron
code repo to address many pain points. NEC OpenFlow Neutron plugin is
maintained in a separate module.
